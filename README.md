📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW

The primary objective of this project was to gain a practical understanding of how **large-scale, real-world websites** are structured and styled. By recreating the Amazon homepage layout, I focused on learning how multiple UI components work together to form a complete and visually consistent web interface.

This project helped me transition from learning individual HTML and CSS concepts to **applying them in a realistic project scenario**
